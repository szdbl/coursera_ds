## Description

The Shiny App I wrote displays energy consumption information:

- gas
- electricity
- water

for the years 2012 to 2014.

---
## Details

Every Sunday, I write down in an Excel sheet the figures displayed by the
different meters.

These data are diffed, week by week, so that I get the week's consumption.

Further more, a formula is applied to compute an estimate price (expressed in
EUR) for the week's consumption.

## Example

Here are the first 10 lines of the Excel file (for the columns which interest
me, the ones I show in the barplot):


```

## 10 2012-03-04    40.49     21.38       3.66
```

## Lessons learned

- Necessary to use reactive function as soon as I have 2 inputs or more.

- In the renderPlot function, the name of the dataframe must be followed by
  parentheses.

## Conclusion

- Writing the application + these slides took me around 3 hours.
  That's pretty excellent for making such a huge work available (displayable,
  testable) by third parties.  A wonder, in fact.
